This section contains the codes of the N-body simulation. The N_body.py is the code used to generate all the simulations in the presentation folder. The test3.py takes 
a much longer time to run since it uses numerical integration instead of trapezoidal rule. The only propose of test.py is to illustrate that numerical integration and trapezoidal
rule  will give the same result.
